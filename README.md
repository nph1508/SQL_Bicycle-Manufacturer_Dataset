## üìå Background & Overview
üéØ Objective
This project aims to support decision-making for the sales and inventory management team at a fictional bicycle manufacturing company. We leverage SQL on BigQuery to uncover:

‚úîÔ∏è Product subcategory sales trends (volume, value, frequency)

‚úîÔ∏è Year-over-year growth by product line

‚úîÔ∏è Regional sales performance

‚úîÔ∏è Customer retention patterns

‚úîÔ∏è Inventory fluctuations and planning signals

All queries were executed using SQL with Common Table Expressions (CTEs), joins, aggregation, and analytic functions.
## üìÇ Dataset Description & Data Structure

### üìå Data Source

- **Source:** Google BigQuery Public Dataset `bigquery-public-data`  
- **Dataset:** Simulated bicycle sales and operations data (AdventureWorks-style)  
- **Format:** `.sql` (Queried directly in BigQuery)

### üìä Data Structure & Relationships
**Key Tables Used:**
- `Sales.SalesOrderDetail`
- `Production.Product`
- `Production.ProductSubcategory`
- `Sales.SalesTerritory`
- `Sales.SalesOrderHeader`
- `Person.Person`
- `Person.Address`
- `Production.ProductInventory`

**Schema Highlights:**
- `SalesOrderDetail` links with `Product` ‚Üí `ProductSubcategory`
- `SalesOrderHeader` links with customer and territory info
- `ProductInventory` provides stock levels over time

> üìå All tables joined via foreign key relationships using `ProductID`, `SalesOrderID`, `CustomerID`, `TerritoryID`.
## ‚öíÔ∏èMain Process
### Query 01: Calc Quantity of items, Sales value & Order quantity by each Subcategory in L12M
**Purpose:** Calculates quantity sold, total sales, and number of orders by product subcategory over the last 12 months.  
**Goal:** Understand sales performance by product name to identify strong and weak performers.
```sql
SELECT 
  FORMAT_DATE('%b %Y', sale.ModifiedDate) as period
  , pro.Name as name
  , sum(sale.OrderQty) as qty_item
  , sum(sale.LineTotal) as total_sale
  , count(distinct sale.SalesOrderID) as order_cnt
FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` as sale
JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.Product` as pro
USING (ProductID)
WHERE DATE(sale.ModifiedDate) >= (
    SELECT DATE_SUB(MAX(DATE(sale.ModifiedDate)), INTERVAL 12 MONTH) 
    FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail`
)
Group by period, pro.Name
order by period;
```
#### ‚úÖ Results:

**üìù Observation:** 
### Query 02: Calc % YoY growth rate by SubCategory & release top 3 cat with highest grow rate. Can use metric: quantity_item. Round results to 2 decimal
**Purpose:** Calculates Year-over-Year growth rate in item quantity by subcategory and identifies top 3 subcategories with highest growth.  
**Goal:** Detect which subcategories are expanding fastest and deserve investment.
```sql
with 
sale_info as (
  SELECT 
      FORMAT_TIMESTAMP("%Y", a.ModifiedDate) as yr,
      c.Name,
      sum(a.OrderQty) as qty_item
  FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` a 
  LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.Product` b on a.ProductID = b.ProductID
  LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.ProductSubcategory` c on cast(b.ProductSubcategoryID as int) = c.ProductSubcategoryID
  GROUP BY 1,2
),

sale_diff as (
  select *,
    lead(qty_item) over (partition by Name order by yr desc) as prv_qty,
    round(qty_item / lead(qty_item) over (partition by Name order by yr desc) - 1, 2) as qty_diff
  from sale_info
),

rk_qty_diff as (
  select *,
    dense_rank() over(order by qty_diff desc) as dk
  from sale_diff
)

select 
  Name
  , qty_item
  , prv_qty
  , qty_diff
from (
  select Name, qty_item, prv_qty, qty_diff, dk
  from rk_qty_diff
  where dk <= 3
)
order by dk;
```
#### ‚úÖ Results:
| Name            | qty_item | prv_qty | qty_diff |
| --------------- | -------- | ------- | -------- |
| Mountain Frames | 3168     | 510     | 5.21     |
| Socks           | 2724     | 523     | 4.21     |
| Road Frames     | 5564     | 1137    | 3.89     |

**üìù Observation:** 
### Query 3: Ranking Top 3 TeritoryID with biggest Order quantity of every year. If there's TerritoryID with same quantity in a year, do not skip the rank number
**Purpose:** Ranks the top 3 sales territories each year by total order quantity using DENSE_RANK to handle ties.  
**Goal:** Monitor geographical sales performance and territory contribution over time.
```sql
WITH base_data AS (
  SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM SH.OrderDate) AS yr,
    SH.TerritoryID,
    SUM(SD.OrderQty) AS TotalQty
  FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` AS SD
  JOIN `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderHeader` AS SH
    ON SD.SalesOrderID = SH.SalesOrderID
  GROUP BY yr, SH.TerritoryID
),
ranked_data AS (
  SELECT
    yr,
    TerritoryID,
    TotalQty,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY yr ORDER BY TotalQty DESC) AS rk
  FROM base_data
)
SELECT 
  yr,
  TerritoryID,
  TotalQty AS order_cnt,
  rk
FROM ranked_data
WHERE rk <= 3
ORDER BY yr, rk;
```
#### ‚úÖ Results:
| yr | TerritoryID | order_cnt | rk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| 2014 | 1 | 8823 | 3 |

**üìù Observation:** 
### Query 04: Calc Total Discount Cost belongs to Seasonal Discount for each SubCategory
**Purpose:** Calculates the total discount cost applied under "Seasonal Discount" for each subcategory and year.  
**Goal:** Measure promotional investment and its cost distribution across subcategories.
```sql
select 
    FORMAT_TIMESTAMP("%Y", ModifiedDate)
    , Name
    , sum(disc_cost) as total_cost
from (
      select distinct a.ModifiedDate
      , c.Name
      , d.DiscountPct, d.Type
      , a.OrderQty * d.DiscountPct * UnitPrice as disc_cost 
      from `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` a
      LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.Product` b on a.ProductID = b.ProductID
      LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.ProductSubcategory` c on cast(b.ProductSubcategoryID as int) = c.ProductSubcategoryID
      LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Sales.SpecialOffer` d on a.SpecialOfferID = d.SpecialOfferID
      WHERE lower(d.Type) like '%seasonal discount%' 
)
group by 1,2;
```
#### ‚úÖ Results:

**Goal:** Analyze retention behavior of customers who had successfully shipped orders during 2014.
```sql
with info as(
  select
    extract(month from ModifiedDate) AS mth_order,
    extract(year from ModifiedDate) AS yr,
    CustomerID,
    count(distinct SalesOrderID) as sales_cnt
  from `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderHeader`
  where Status = 5 and extract(year FROM ModifiedDate) = 2014
  Group by 1,2,3

**üìù Observation:** Helmets and caps frequently co-occur with bikes, suggesting high potential for accessory bundles.
### "Query 08: No of order and value at Pending status in 2014
**Purpose:** Calculates total number of orders and their total value where the order status is "Pending" in the year 2014.
**Goal:** Quantify backlog impact on operations and potential unrealized revenue.
```sql
select 
    extract (year from ModifiedDate) as yr
    , Status
    , count(distinct PurchaseOrderID) as order_Cnt 
    , round(sum(TotalDue),2)  as value
from `adventureworks2019.Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader`
where Status = 1
and extract(year from ModifiedDate) = 2014
group by 1,2;
```
#### ‚úÖ Results:
| yr | Status | order_Cnt | value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2014 | 1 | 224 | 3,873,579.01 |

**üìù Observation:** A notable amount of orders remain in pending status throughout 2014, indicating possible issues in order fulfillment or approval workflows.
## üîé Final Conclusion & Recommendations

üëâüèª Based on the insights and findings above, we would recommend the **Sales & Inventory Management Team** to consider the following:

### üìå Key Takeaways:

‚úîÔ∏è **Invest in high-growth subcategories** like Mountain Frames and Socks, which show strong YoY demand expansion.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Focus territory-specific campaigns** in consistently top-performing regions (Territory 4, 6, 1) to sustain sales dominance.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Improve inventory planning** by closely monitoring stock volatility and aligning supply with historical monthly patterns to reduce stockouts and overstocking.
