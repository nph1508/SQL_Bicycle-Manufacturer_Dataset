## üìå Background & Overview
üéØ Objective
This project aims to support decision-making for the sales and inventory management team at a fictional bicycle manufacturing company. We leverage SQL on BigQuery to uncover:

‚úîÔ∏è Product subcategory sales trends (volume, value, frequency)

‚úîÔ∏è Year-over-year growth by product line

‚úîÔ∏è Regional sales performance

‚úîÔ∏è Customer retention patterns

‚úîÔ∏è Inventory fluctuations and planning signals

All queries were executed using SQL with Common Table Expressions (CTEs), joins, aggregation, and analytic functions.
## üìÇ Dataset Description & Data Structure

### üìå Data Source

- **Source:** Google BigQuery Public Dataset `bigquery-public-data`  
- **Dataset:** Simulated bicycle sales and operations data (AdventureWorks-style)  
- **Format:** `.sql` (Queried directly in BigQuery)

### üìä Data Structure & Relationships
**Key Tables Used:**
- `Sales.SalesOrderDetail`
- `Production.Product`
- `Production.ProductSubcategory`
- `Sales.SalesTerritory`
- `Sales.SalesOrderHeader`
- `Person.Person`
- `Person.Address`
- `Production.ProductInventory`

**Schema Highlights:**
- `SalesOrderDetail` links with `Product` ‚Üí `ProductSubcategory`
- `SalesOrderHeader` links with customer and territory info
- `ProductInventory` provides stock levels over time

> üìå All tables joined via foreign key relationships using `ProductID`, `SalesOrderID`, `CustomerID`, `TerritoryID`.

## ‚öíÔ∏èMain Process
### Query 01: Calc Quantity of items, Sales value & Order quantity by each Subcategory in L12M
**Purpose:** Calculates quantity sold, total sales, and number of orders by product subcategory over the last 12 months.  
**Goal:** Understand sales performance by product name to identify strong and weak performers.
```sql
select 
  format_date('%b %Y', sale.ModifiedDate) as period
  , pro.Name as name
  , sum(sale.OrderQty) as qty_item
  , sum(sale.LineTotal) as total_sale
  , count(distinct sale.SalesOrderID) as order_cnt
from `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` as sale
join `adventureworks2019.Production.Product` as pro
using (ProductID)
where date(sale.ModifiedDate) >=
(
    select date_sub(max(date(sale.ModifiedDate)), interval 12 month) 
    from `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail`
)
group by period, pro.Name
order by period;
```
**‚úÖ Results:**
